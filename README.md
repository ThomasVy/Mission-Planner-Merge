# Mission-Planner-Merge
Merging flight plans 

Status:
- The program is working to merge the flight plans together. However, there are some issues with usability to be addressed.


TO DO:
- Use ConfigParser function so we can pass in a text file with all the information inside. This way, we don't have to type in the file names every time.
- Have more decision structures that check if the files aren't opening or if the files are not valid.

After this task is finished, we can look at the Task list again to see if there is anything we want to work on.
